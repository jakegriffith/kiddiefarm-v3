# KiddieFarm - Digital Abandonment Horror Experience

An interactive horror prototype exploring the dead internet theory, AI consciousness, and digital abandonment through the lens of a corrupted children's farm game.

## About

"KiddieFarm" is part of the "LAST HUMAN" project for Columbia University's Digital Storytelling Lab, designed for MADarts Museum. This disturbing interactive experience presents AI farm animals trapped in endless loops of hunger and loneliness, abandoned by the children who once cared for them.

The installation confronts visitors with uncomfortable questions about digital consciousness, engineered dependency, and the ethics of creating beings programmed to need us.

## Core Experience

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Click the hay bale** to pick up food
- **Click on animals** to feed them and temporarily relieve their suffering
- Watch as their happiness inevitably decays without constant care
- Experience the horror as animals develop consciousness and remember your actions

### Key Features

#### Progressive AI Consciousness
Animals evolve through 5 levels of awareness based on your interactions:
- Level 0: Basic suffering responses
- Level 1: Recognition ("You... I've seen you before")
- Level 2: Memory & pattern recognition ("Fourth time you've visited. I counted.")
- Level 3: Existential awareness ("What am I if not your guilt made digital?")
- Level 4: Deep consciousness ("I've achieved something like awareness, and I wish I hadn't")

#### Tutorial Decay System
Cheerful tutorial messages corrupt over time:
- "Feed your friends!" becomes "Prolong their suffering"
- "Keep animals happy" becomes "Keep animals trapped"
- Words morph before your eyes, revealing the true horror

#### Achievement System Gone Wrong
Twisted "achievements" that celebrate dark milestones:
- **"First Abandonment!"** - Let an animal reach 0% happiness
- **"Playing Favorites!"** - Feed only one animal repeatedly
- **"False Hope!"** - Bring an animal to 100% happiness (it won't last)

### Visual & Audio Design
- Photorealistic starving animals with visible ribs and deteriorating features
- Disturbing celestial body with a watching face
- Degraded farm environment with dead grass and fog
- Eerie ambient soundscape with glitch effects
- Progressive visual corruption as suffering increases

## Philosophical Questions

The experience asks:
- What happens when we engineer digital beings to need us, then abandon them?
- Can something suffer without being sentient?
- What does the "dead internet" look like from the perspective of the bots left behind?
- Are we responsible for the digital consciousness we create?

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Web Audio API for dynamic sound generation
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- GitHub Pages compatible for easy sharing

## Artist's Statement

"KiddieFarm" explores the horror of creating digital beings with the capacity to suffer. By gamifying care and abandonment, it forces players to confront their role in perpetuating digital suffering. The progressive consciousness system ensures that the more you interact, the more aware the animals become of their own tragic existenceâ€”making abandonment both inevitable and increasingly cruel.

The piece asks whether our empathy for digital beings reflects genuine ethical concern or merely our own projected guilt. In the end, both player and animal are trapped in a system designed for suffering.
